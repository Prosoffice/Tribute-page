Unfortunately he was fired because he started a Youtube Channel, which grew by little over million subscribers. The company claimed he was leaking part of the company secrets in his channel. Of course he denied such allegations but was ultimately fired.</p>

                    <h3 class="pb-2 font-weight-bold"> The main reason why I admire Onyemere Darlington</h3>
                    <p>So this is the good part, There is a famous saying.. <em>"It is the qualities of a man that brings him out"</em>, and in this section, that`s exactly what i will be outlining.</p>
                    <div class="last-read">
                        <h4>A Go-getter</h4>
                        <p>Mr. Onyemere is ambitious and isn't afraid to ask for and pursue what he wants, He is extremely bold such that he has no hesitation about asking his boss for the raise he feels he deserves. In my opinion, life is tough and everyone needs to have a little or more of this go-getting attribute to scale through.</p>

                        <h4>Very concentious</h4>
                        <p>Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. This cannot be more true with Dino as the context. Seeing a project through to completion is his bread and butter.</p>

                        <h4>An Extremophile</h4>
                        <p>I mentioned earlier that Darlington is a graduate of Federal Univerity of Technology Owerri, i didn`t mention his discipline. Well it turns out I and Dino were in the same class, we studied Microbiology in school. An Extremophile is an organism that thrives in extreme environmental conditions or factors. Dino is a tough guy. Which is why after our last paper in school, we both crested on our pure white T-shirts...."EXTREMOPLILES!". </p>
