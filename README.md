This is a personal project rapidly developed by Yours Truly. It is my first project as an Intern at WEJAPA.This single page website (Can be accessed via the Github page link) is a tribute. 
A tribute of a friend whom i admire and hope to adopt his core Strengths and fundamentals. 
This project was carried out to confirm and demostrate my understanding of the essentials and basics of HTML and CSS after two(2) weeks of Intense training.
